### 🧠 What it is
A simple web app that lets you generate images based on AI, likely using a backend model like Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, or similar. It provides selections for realistic, anime-style, and other presets:

- Realistic

- Anime

- Flux‑Schnell (possibly a fast “flux” style) And aspect ratio options: 1:1, 16:9, 9:16.


###  💻 How it works

- You click one of the style presets or choose an aspect ratio.

- Click "Generate Image".

- The app shows “Generating Image…” and then displays the result when ready.
It’s a client-facing UI hosted on Netlify—likely the actual image generation runs via an external API or remote server.


###  🎯 Features & Interface
- Two buttons labeled “Image” at top (icons), plus “Generate Image” control.

- Preset styles are selectable (e.g. Realistic, Anime, Flux-Schnell).

- Choices for image ratio: square (1:1), landscape (16:9), vertical (9:16).

- Live feedback showing "Generating Image..." while waiting.




### 🧩 Limitations & Considerations

- No prompt input field—likely limited to presets and styles.

- No download/share options apparent—mainly for quick demo or testing.

- If it’s a demo or staging site, performance and uptime may vary.

- Without browser console access, it’s unclear which AI model or API it uses.


### 🚀 Use Cases
- Content creators who need fast image ideas.

- Designers looking for style-specific inspiration.

- Developers or testers exploring AI image APIs.

- Social media marketers needing quick visuals in various ratios.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- No custom prompt input field (only preset styles).

- Limited to frontend actions—actual model/API details are abstracted.

- Intended for fast generation, not fine-tuned customization.
